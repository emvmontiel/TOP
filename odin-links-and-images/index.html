<!--
    Links are created using the anchor element, which is represented by the a tag
    The a tag has an href attribute which specifies the destination of the link
    -->
<!-- 
    HTML attribute examples are: lang="en" and href="www.facebook.com"
    An attribute is usually made up of two parts: a name, and a value
    However, not all attributes require a value 

    href attribute â€” stands for hypertext reference attribute
    The value of the href attribute is the destination we want our link to go to
    -->

<!--
    There are two types of links: absolute and relative

    Absolute links to a different website
    Absolute links include the scheme and domain e.g. https://www.theodinproject.com/about

    Relative links to a different page within the present website
    Relative links only include the file path to the other page e.g. about.html
    -->

<!-- 
    To attach images, you can use the img element
    The img is a void element which means it doesn't have a closing tag
    It has a src attribute
    It can also have an alt attribute which stands for alternative text; used to describe the attached image. It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded.
    It is a good habit to specify the width and height attributes to help the browser layout the page without causing the page to jump and flash
