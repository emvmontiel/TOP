CSS is made up of various rules. 
Each rule is made up of a selector and a semicolon-separated list of declarations.
Each declaration is made up of a property-value pair.

    div.bold-text {
        font-weight: 700;
    }

    div.bold-text 	> selector
    font-weight 	> property
    700		        > value

A div element is one of the basic HMTL elements
It is simply an empty container

Selectors refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply.

<!-- index.html -->

    <div>Hello, World!</div>
    <p>Hi...</p>
    <div>Okay, bye.</div>
    <div class="alert-text">Please agree to our terms of service.</div>

Universal selector — selects elements of every type; asterisk (*)
Type selectors — selects elements of the given element type; name of element type (div)
Class selectors — selects elements of the given class; period + name of class (.alert-text)
ID selectors — selects elements of the give ID; hashtag + name of ID (#title)

Notes: 
You can use the same class on as many elements as you want
Class selectors won't work if the class name begins with a number
You are able to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated list; class="alert-text severe-alert"
Major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have one ID
IDs cannot be repeated on a single page and should not contain any whitespace
ID selectors won't work if the class name begins with a number
Selectors can be grouped together as a comma-separated list to cut down on the repetition

You can do it like the following:

    .read,
    .unread {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
    }

    .read {
    /* several unique declarations */
    }

    .unread {
    /* several unique declarations */
    }

Chaining selectors

Class selectors

    .subsection.header {
    color: red;
    }


Class and ID

    .subsection#preview {
    color: blue;
    }

Descendant combinators

    .ancestor .contents {
    /* some declarations */
    }

Color property — sets the text color of an element
Background-color — sets the background color of an element
Both properties accept keywords, HEX, RGB, and HSL values.

    p {
    /* keyword example: */
    color: red;
    }

    p {
    /* hex example: */
    color: #1100ff;
    }

    p {
    /* rgb example: */
    color: rgb(100, 0, 127);
    }

    p {
    /* hsl example: */
    color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);
    }

TYPOGRAPHY BASICS AND TEXT-ALIGN

Font-family 
> can be a single value
> can be a comma-separated list of values
> determines what font an element uses

IMAGE HEIGHT AND WIDTH
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-intro-to-css#image-height-and-width

If you wanted to adjust the size of the image without causing it to lose its proportions, you would use a value of “auto” for the height property and adjust the width value.
