        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 kg chicken</li>
                <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 cup vinegar</li>
                <li>1 head garlic, crushed</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>1 tsp whole peppercorns</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Marinate the chicken – In a large bowl, combine the chicken, soy sauce, and crushed garlic. Mix well, cover, and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight in the refrigerator for better flavor).</li>
                <li>Sear the chicken – Heat a pot or deep pan over medium heat. Add a little oil (optional), then take the chicken pieces out of the marinade and sear them until lightly browned on all sides. This step adds more flavor.</li>
                <li>Add the marinade – Pour the marinade (soy sauce and garlic) back into the pot with the chicken.</li>
                <li>Add vinegar (do not stir yet) – Pour in the vinegar and let it simmer uncovered for a few minutes without stirring. This helps cook off the strong acidic taste.</li>
                <li>Add the rest of the ingredients – Drop in the bay leaves, peppercorns, and water. Mix gently.</li>
                <li>Simmer – Cover the pot and let it simmer over low to medium heat for about 30–40 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked and tender. Stir occasionally.</li>
                <li>Adjust seasoning – Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper as needed. If you prefer it a bit thicker, continue simmering uncovered until the sauce reduces to your liking.</li>
                <li>Serve – Transfer to a serving dish and enjoy with steamed rice.</li>
            </ol>
